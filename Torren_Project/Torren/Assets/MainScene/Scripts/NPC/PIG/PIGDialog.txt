Hey! Oink! Oink! Hey you! Oink!
Do you have food? Oink!
I'm hungy and there's no more food around here... oink!
The forest is dead now. Oink!
Whatever that man did... oink oink! There are no more fruits on the trees oink!
How are we going to survive? Oink! Oh I can't oink bear to think about it! Oink!
Will you help us? Oink! Can you help restore our forest to the way it was? Oink! Please! Oink!
There's a shiny thing over there oink!
I tried to eat it oink! Not very tasty! Oink! 
Maybe you can do something with it? Oink!
